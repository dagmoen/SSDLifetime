# SSDLifetime

I'm not a bigtime programmer, just making stuff I find useful, any help is appriciated :)

I use BGInfo to display hostname, ipaddress, freespace on my desktop background image, and I wanted to get the lifetime for my SSD displayed also.

This vbscript extract SMART data from my hdd, field 233 goes from 100 and down to 1 for SSD drives and shows the life time of the SSD disk.

I used this script

and took away alot to fit my need, I guess there are some improvments that can be done, any help would be great :)
